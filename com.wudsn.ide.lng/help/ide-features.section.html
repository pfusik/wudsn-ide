<ul>
	<li>The Eclipse platform contains editors like for example the generic text editor. Editors can support one or more
		content types identified by file extensions. One editor can be the default for a specific file extension. WUDSN
		IDE provides an assembler editor and a corresponding content type for every compiler. Every assembler editor has
		a default compiler associated which in turn defines via the preferences which application is used to run the
		output file. <br /> <img src="productions/java/ide/features/ide-editor-content-types.png"
			alt="IDE editors, content types and file associations" /></li>
	<li>New content types and file associations for Atari 2600 compilers
		<ul>
			<li>DASM Source File (*.asm)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>New content types and file associations for Atari 8-bit compilers
		<ul>
			<li>ATASM Source File (*.asm)</li>
			<li>MADS Source File (*.asm, default)</li>
			<li>XASM Source File (*.asx, default)</li>

	<li>New content types and file associations for NES compilers
		<ul>
			<li>ASM6 Source File (*.asm)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The default editor for an extension can be configured in section "File Associations" of the preferences with the
		button "Default" <br /> <img src="productions/java/ide/features/ide-editor-file-associations.gif"
			alt="IDE file associations" /></li>
	<li>Syntax highlighting colors and styles for comments, directives, all types of identifiers, legal opcodes, illegal
		opcodes, pseudo opcodes, and strings</li>
	<li>Single line comments for the current line selection can be toggled using "CTRL-7" or the editor context menu
		entry "Toggle Comment"</li>

	<li>Adding support for new compilers and application is possible via Eclipse extension points <br /> <img

	<li>Build or build and run with a single keystroke or via the menu</li>
	<li>Toolbar button for "Build and Run" which adapts to the hardware of the currently opened editor, for example,
		it will show a C64 icon when using the "ACME (C64)" editor</li>
	<li>The toolbar button for "Build and Run" offers a pulldown menu that allows running the output file with any of
		the applications configured in the preferences. This way you can run the output file easily with different
		emulators without changing the preferences. That can be very helpful if one emulator shows different behavior
		than another or in case you have specified a build script as a user-defined application in the preferences

	<li>Console view with original compiler output opens automatically in the background after compiling which useful in
		cases where the plugin is not yet complete. The "Compiler Console" is automatically brought to front when the
		compiler starts. This prevents the compiler output from being hidden behind other consoles in the console view

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Hyperlink navigation via CTRL-click to labels equates, local definitions, macro definitions, and procedure
		definitions. In case there is only one target, direct navigation takes place. In case there is more than one
		possible target, the type and line number of the target are displayed in a hyperlink popup. All included source
		files are also taken into account like in the content outline. In case there are targets from different files,
		the file name is also displayed as a differentiator in the hyperlink popup. <br /> <br /> <img

			alt="Open With Hex Editor" /></li>
	<li>The "Open With Hex Editor" menu entry closes an existing editor in case the file is already opened and thereby
		forces the file to be opened with the hex editor. In addition, the hex editor is set as the default editor for
		this file. As a consequence double-clicking the file in the package explorer will open it automatically with the
		hex editor, no matter which type of file is actually is. This saves you from always using the context menu, just
		because the file has no known file type. You can change the default editor again by just using the "Open With"
		context menu entry</li>
	<li>Available via hyperlink navigation for binary includes</li>
	<li>Context menu to copy parts of the file into the clipboard in different formats:
		<ul>
			<li>hex values (".byte $01,$02,...")</li>
			<li>decimal values (".byte 1,2,...")</li>
			<li>ASCII string</li>
		</ul>
		This is very helpful to turn parts of a file into source code. The possibility to copy/paste into the binary
		file itself in order to modify is prepared but not working yet and will be completed later. <br /> <img
			src="productions/java/ide/features/ide-hex-editor-context-menu.png" alt="Hex Editor context menu" /></li>

	</li>
	<li>The possible file modes for a binary file are computed automatically and used as default when opening the file
	</li>
	<li>Unsupported file modes are detected and cannot be used</li>
	<li>Files with a block structure get an outline in the outline view</li>
	<li>Files with a corrupted block structure are detected and displayed as good as possible <br /> <img

	<li>Viewer for binary files and 8-bit image files. <br /> The most suitable supported converter and the

<ul>
	<li>For most use-cases, the defaults provided for the compilers and in the preferences are sufficient. But if you
		want to develop in parallel in multiple projects, for different platforms (Apple II and Atari 8-bit) or in
		different output formats (".XEX" and ".BIN") with the same compiler it may become cumbersome to change the
		preferences every time. Therefore WUDSN IDE offers annotations that you can put into the source code files.
		These annotations override the defaults and the preferences.</li>
	<li>All language annotations start with the prefix "@com.wudsn.ide.lng." followed by the lower case name of the annotation,
		an equals sign, and the unquoted value. Example: "@com.wudsn.ide.lng.hardware=ATARI8BIT"</li>
    <li>In earlier versions of WUDSN, language annotations started with the prefix "@com.wudsn.ide.asm.".
        While they are still evaluated, it is strongly recommended to adapt to the new prefix.</li>
	<li>All annotations can be placed in comment lines at the beginning of a source file. Some of the annotations are
		only relevant for the main source file, some are only relevant in include source files, some are relevant for
		all source files.</li>
	<li>@com.wudsn.ide.lng.hardware
		<ul>
			<li>Defines the target hardware for which the preferences shall be evaluated, in particular, which emulator
				is used to run the output file.</li>
			<li>Allowed values are "APPLE2", "ATARI2600", "ATARI7800", "ATARI8BIT", "C64", "NES".</li>
			<li>This annotation is relevant for all source files.</li>
			<li>This annotation is only evaluated when a file is opened. So if you add this annotation or change its
				value, you have to close and re-open the file once.</li>
			<li>Example: @com.wudsn.ide.lng.hardware=ATARI8BIT</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>@com.wudsn.ide.lng.mainsourcefile
		<ul>
			<li>Defines the main source file to which the current include source file belongs. When the "Compile" action
				is executed, the main source file is compiler instead of the current file.</li>
			<li>Allowed values are file paths relative to the folder of the current include source file and absolute
				file paths.</li>
			<li>This annotation is only relevant in include source files.</li>
			<li>Example: @com.wudsn.ide.lng.mainsourcefile=ExampleMain.asm</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>@com.wudsn.ide.lng.outputfoldermode
		<ul>
			<li>Overrides the "Output Folder Mode" from the preferences.</li>
			<li>Allowed values are "SOURCE_FOLDER", "TEMP_FOLDER", "FIXED_FOLDER".</li>
			<li>This annotation is only relevant in the main source file.</li>
			<li>Example: @com.wudsn.ide.lng.outputfoldermode=SOURCE_FOLDER</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>@com.wudsn.ide.lng.outputfolder
		<ul>
			<li>Overrides the "Output Folder" from the preferences and the "@com.wudsn.ide.lng.outputfoldermode"
				annotation.</li>
			<li>Allowed values are file paths relative to the folder of the main source file and absolute file paths.
			</li>
			<li>This annotation is only relevant in the main source file.</li>
			<li>Example: @com.wudsn.ide.lng.outputfolder=..\out</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>@com.wudsn.ide.lng.outputfileextension
		<ul>
			<li>Overrides the "Output File Extension" from the preferences.</li>
			<li>Allowed values have to start with a period.</li>
			<li>This annotation is only relevant in the main source file.</li>
			<li>Example: @com.wudsn.ide.lng.outputfileextension=.bin</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>@com.wudsn.ide.lng.outputfile
		<ul>
			<li>Overrides the "Output Folder", "Output File Extension" from the preferences and the automatic
				computation of the out file name based on the main source file name.</li>
			<li>Allowed values are file paths relative to the folder of the main source file and absolute file paths.
			</li>
			<li>This annotation is only relevant in the main source file.</li>
			<li>Example: @com.wudsn.ide.lng.outputfile=..\out\output.bin</li>
